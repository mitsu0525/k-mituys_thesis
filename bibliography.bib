abstract = {Today, three different physical (PHY) layers for the IEEE 802.11 WLAN are available (802.11a/b/g); they all provide multi-rate capabilities. To achieve a high performance un-der varying conditions, these devices need to adapt their transmission rate dynamically. While this rate adaptation algorithm is a critical component of their performance, only very few algorithms such as Auto Rate Fallback (ARF) or Receiver Based Auto Rate (RBAR) have been published and the implementation challenges associated with these mech-anisms have never been publicly discussed. In this paper, we first present the important characteristics of the 802.11 systems that must be taken into account when such algo-rithms are designed. Specifically, we emphasize the contrast between low latency and high latency systems, and we give examples of actual chipsets that fall in either of the dif-ferent categories. We propose an Adaptive ARF (AARF) algorithm for low latency systems that improves upon ARF to provide both short-term and long-term adaptation. The new algorithm has very low complexity while obtaining a performance similar to RBAR, which requires incompatible changes to the 802.11 MAC and PHY protocol. Finally, we present a new rate adaptation algorithm designed for high latency systems that has been implemented and evaluated on an AR5212-based device. Experimentation results show a clear performance improvement over the algorithm previ-ously implemented in the AR5212 driver we used.},

Wi-Fi was not designed to operate in such scenarios. Because of its contention based channel access and backoff procedure, Wi-Fi presents low channel access efficiency and sensible performance degradation in terms of user throughput for dense deployments. This paper discusses the challenges of Wi-Fi operation in dense deployment scenarios and the benefits of a proposed adaptive transmit power mechanism.

Most recently, the IEEE working group has triggered the IEEE 802.11ax project, which aims to amend the current IEEE 802.11 standard to improve efficiency of dense WLANs. In this paper, we evaluate the Dynamic Sensitivity Control (DSC) Algorithm proposed for IEEE 802.11ax. This algorithm dynamically adjusts the Carrier Sense Threshold (CST) based on the average received signal strength. We show that the aggregate throughput of a dense network utilizing DSC is considerably improved (i.e. up to 20{\%}) when compared with the IEEE 802.11 legacy network.},

abstract = {A new generation of Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs) will make its appearance in the market in the forthcoming years based on the amendments to the IEEE 802.11 standards that have recently been approved or are under development. Examples of the most expected ones are IEEE 802.11aa (Robust Audio Video Transport Streaming), IEEE 802.11ac (Very-high throughput at {\textless} 6 GHz), IEEE 802.11af (TV White Spaces) and IEEE 802.11ah (Machine-to-Machine communications) specifications. The aim of this survey is to provide a comprehensive overview of these novel technical features and the related open technical challenges that will drive the future WLAN evolution. In contrast to other IEEE 802.11 surveys, this is a use case oriented study. Specifically, we first describe the three key scenarios in which next-generation WLANs will have to operate. We then review the most relevant amendments for each of these use cases focusing on the additional functionalities and the new technologies they include, such as multi-user MIMO techniques, groupcast communications, dynamic channel bonding, spectrum databases and channel sensing, enhanced power saving mechanisms and efficient small data transmissions. We also discuss the related work to highlight the key issues that must still be addressed. Finally, we review emerging trends that can influence the design of future WLANs, with special focus on software-defined MACs and the internet-working with cellular systems.},

Bayesian optimization employs the Bayesian technique of setting a prior over the objective function and combining it with evidence to get a posterior function. This permits a utility-based selection of the next observation to make on the objective function, which must take into account both exploration (sampling from areas of high uncertainty) and exploitation (sampling areas likely to offer improvement over the current best observation). We also present two detailed extensions of Bayesian optimization, with experiments-active user modelling with preferences, and hierarchical reinforcement learning-and a discussion of the pros and cons of Bayesian optimization based on our experiences.},

@techreport{Srinivas,
abstract = {Many applications require optimizing an unknown , noisy function that is expensive to evaluate. We formalize this task as a multi-armed bandit problem, where the payoff function is either sampled from a Gaussian process (GP) or has low RKHS norm. We resolve the important open problem of deriving regret bounds for this setting, which imply novel convergence rates for GP optimization. We analyze GP-UCB, an intuitive upper-confidence based algorithm, and bound its cumulative regret in terms of maximal information gain, establishing a novel connection between GP optimization and experimental design. Moreover, by bounding the latter in terms of operator spectra, we obtain explicit sublinear regret bounds for many commonly used covari-ance functions. In some important cases, our bounds have surprisingly weak dependence on the dimensionality. In our experiments on real sensor data, GP-UCB compares favorably with other heuristical GP optimization approaches.},

  abstract = 	 {Bayesian optimization is an efficient way to optimize expensive black-box functions such as designing a new product with highest quality or hyperparameter tuning of a machine learning algorithm. However, it has a serious limitation when the parameter space is high-dimensional as Bayesian optimization crucially depends on solving a global optimization of a surrogate utility function in the same sized dimensions. The surrogate utility function, known commonly as acquisition function is a continuous function but can be extremely sharp at high dimension - having only a few peaks marooned in a large terrain of almost flat surface. Global optimization algorithms such as DIRECT are infeasible at higher dimensions and gradient-dependent methods cannot move if initialized in the flat terrain. We propose an algorithm that enables local gradient-dependent algorithms to move through the flat terrain by using a sequence of gross-to-finer Gaussian process priors on the objective function as we leverage two underlying facts - a) there exists a large enough length-scales for which the acquisition function can be made to have a significant gradient at any location in the parameter space, and b) the extrema of the consecutive acquisition functions are close although they are different only due to a small difference in the length-scales. Theoretical guarantees are provided and experiments clearly demonstrate the utility of the proposed method at high dimension using both benchmark test functions and real-world case studies.}

@article{Garrido-Merchan2018,
abstract = {Bayesian Optimization (BO) methods are useful for optimizing functions that are expen- sive to evaluate, lack an analytical expression and whose evaluations can be contaminated by noise. These methods rely on a probabilistic model of the objective function, typically a Gaussian process (GP), upon which an acquisition function is built. The acquisition function guides the optimization process and measures the expected utility of performing an evaluation of the objective at a new point. GPs assume continous input variables. When this is not the case, for example when some of the input variables take categorical or integer values, one has to introduce extra approximations. Consider a suggested input location taking values in the real line. Before doing the evaluation of the objective, a common approach is to use a one hot encoding approximation for categorical variables, or to round to the closest integer, in the case of integer-valued variables. We show that this can lead to problems in the optimization process and describe a more principled approach to account for input variables that are categorical or integer-valued. We illustrate in both synthetic and a real experiments the utility of our approach, which significantly improves the results of standard BO methods using Gaussian processes on problems with categorical or integer-valued variables.},
